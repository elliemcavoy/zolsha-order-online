<h1 id="ux"><u>UX</u></h1>
This websites primary purpose is to allow Zolsha Restaurant & Takeaway's customers to order their favourite dishes from the comfort of their own homes and to have the food either delivered or to allow them to collect the food once it is ready. The functionality is as such that the customers can provide all the relevant details to allow for the food to be delivered and make a secure payment for the order. A website search function will provide any users the ability to search for menu items by a keyword to save them time if they know what they would like to purchase. The ordering system will be available for any visitors to the site however delivery will only be available for customers within a certain distance from the restaurant. Additional functionality will be made available for user's that register on the site such as a profile that stores all previous orders and delivery information to save time for regular customers when ordering.
The website will also have a secondary purpose which is to allow customers to make table reservations for dining in at the restaurant. The user can check availability and if a table is available a booking can be made. Again, a registered user will have the additional functionality to view all of their table reservations in their profile.
The third and final purpose of this website will be to allow the restaurant ovwners and employees to keep up to date with orders and reservations for that day by providing them with a dashboard showing these in a easy to read format. It will also allow them to keep their menu up to date by offering them the opportunity to add new dishes to the menu.

<h2 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h2>
Please see the wireframes for this project:<br>

<h2 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h2>
<ul>
<li>The target audience for this website has a relatively narrow scope. As this is primarily a tool for ordering a food delivery, the target audience will live within a small geographical area surrrounding the restaurant. As delivery is limited to a number of postcodes and customer will not be willing to travel too far to visit the restaurant, I have estimated that the target audience will be based within 7 miles of the restaurant.</li>
<li>The demographic for the consumer audience will be Indian food lovers, aged over 16. </li>
<li>There will also be a secondary audience which is the restaurant owner/employees to allow them to keep up to date with orders and bookings the restaurant has recieved. </li>
</ul><br>
