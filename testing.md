<h2>Lighthouse</h2>
I have used Lighthouse to gain a performance score for this site. Please see below the results.<br>

<h2>Manual Testing of key aspects of the website</h2>
I manually tested the following to make sure they worked as designed:

<h3>Navbar & Collapsible Navbar</h3>
<ul>
<li>The largescreen navbar contains the logo and then the page links visible to the right hand side.</li>
<li>When on a smaller screen, the navbar links are moved into the collapsible navbar to the left hand side or the logo.</li>
<li>The full logo is always visible but the font size reduces as the screen size does to ensure this is possible.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Messages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Messages are displayed when a message is needed to be displayed to the user in an eye-catching way.</li>
<li>Messages are used for the following:
<ul></ul>
</li>
<li>I have tested each function and the messages are displayed correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Responsive Design</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have tested each page on all screen sizes to ensure the design is consistent no matter what device it is being viewed on.</li>
<li>The navbar, as mentioned above, will adapt depending on the screen size to include a collapsible navbar on smaller screens.</li>
<li>The cards used to display the recipes & the favourite recipes are designed to take up 4 columns on a medium & large sized screen. They then change to display across 6 columns on a small screen and then across all 12 columns on an extra small screen such as a smartphone. This means that they are easy to read no matter what size screen they are viewed on.</li>
<li>The forms used for the registration, log in, add and edit recipe are responsive and fit onto each screen size.</li>

<h2>Bugs Discovered</h2>
Here are details of bugs that were discovered during manual testing and how they were rectified.

<ol>


</ol>

<h2>Improvements Made</h2>
<ul>
<li>When testing the user stories, it became apparent that although the user could select specific categories, there was no link to view all menu items. This may not be used by regular users, however if a new user just wanted to get a general overview of the menu, having this option would be beneficial. It is also good practise to have a link to all products available. Therefore this was added to the homepage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bugs still to be rectified</h2>
